- Real-time Heart Rate Tracking: See your heart rate reflected in-game, adding a layer of realism that reflects your exertion during gameplay.
- VR Game Compatibility: Works seamlessly with popular VR titles like Resonant and VR Chat, allowing you to showcase your physical reactions to others.
- OBS Integration: Stream your VR gameplay with your heart rate data overlaid on top, providing viewers with a more engaging and informative experience.
- Standalone Mode: No app required for sending heart rate data via OSC in VRChat on Quest devices or PC.
